For my Sinatra project I chose to create a reviews website. The purpose of the site is allow friends and family to share their reviews of restaurants. The idea behind this is that it's hard to trust large scale review sites' s reviews. Even with more reviews and accredited reviews on Yelp or TripAdvisor, I find myself not always trusting these as they tend to be skewed. Having a repository of friends' restaurant recommendations is actually really helpful and a few of my family members said they'd actually like to use this. 

I started this project thinking I should create a large scale reviews website that incorporates many types of reviews. As I got farther along with this project I realized sticking to restaurant reviews would be feasible given the timeline of this project. Originally I would have a general reviews view that would breakdown by review style. Also each review would have different attributes so you couldn't really have one general reviews template. I originally thought of this in terms of an Excel workbook. If each tab was a different type of review and within that tab or Class was a different set of columns representing features of each review style. Eventually my goal was to rollup these reviews into a summary page that you could drill into for detail. With everything going on now I decided to just streamline this project for the time being and go with restaurants. This idea of scalability of projects is something I'm very interested in as I've seen this in the real world where I used to work (maybe a little less complicated). I could see creating a more scalable project but then again this is really meant for friends and family who are for the most part directly connected to you. 

This project was definitely a challenge but I'm proud of the work I did on it. I like the way I allow users to see reviews of all users and edit/delete their own reviews. I think having a lot of attributes for each review and allowing different form types made this a bit more challenging but I like the way this ultimately turned out. There are a few small tweaks I would like to work on but overrall I'm proud of my project and I think it basically accomplishes what it set out to do.
