After spending some time coding for the last month and a half it's been interesting to see how far I've come. There are many new topics being introduced daily and I find myself very interested in all of this. Some days you may get a little behind but you can come back have days where you get ahead. After completing the CLI project I used pure Ruby Object Orientation and basic CLI to create a project. Now after using Sinatra for a little while I'm definitely seeing how those concepts relate to more real world situations. I like how this course builds on everything you've learned and it seems like each day we are getting to build more dynamic programs that you'd interact with in your life. I am starting to get an idea of what it would be like to work on a website behind the scenes. 

With everything going on in the world currently, I'm very glad I made the decision to join this program. I think there is more of a need than ever to create applications that connect people and make their lives easier. I appreciate the instructors and quality of experience that I'm getting. During this time its a little bit harder to focus but I'm glad I'm doing a constructive activity to improve myself. While I think this can be challenging at times, these skills are worthwhile. 

After working in the financial services field and now learning about software development, like many others, I wish I had done this much sooner. I am beginning to think about what I'd like to do next and I'm not sure whether that means using my previous background or trying something new that comes along. As of right now there is a lot of uncertainty but for me and I'm sure most of the students, being at Flatiron School is a great way to equip yourself with skills for whatever happens next.
