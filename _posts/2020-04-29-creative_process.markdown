After being in this program I see the connection between coding and other parts of my life. Specifically I see some similarities in songwriting. Being someone that likes to  write songs on guitar, bass or piano and have found a similar process of debugging in programming. In music you have more creative freedom but are still somewhat bound by rules regarding music theory. In coding you sort of follow similar principles although they can more detailed. I find the same level of joy from creating a cool program that does something useful as I do when I play music with others or record a piece of music. I think that both incorporate analytical and creative thinking in an abstract way that I've always connected with.This is also what got me interested in writing code in the first place. I'm not the most detailed person but I do like the process of abstract analytical thinking inherent in both activities. 

A lot of the learning of process at the Flatiron School resembles to me what it was like learning to play the guitar. Understanding chords and notes and chord progressions is sort of like learning a language like Ruby and then applying that knowledge of Ruby to Rails is like putting those chords together to write a song. In fact, using Rails is like recording a phrase and playing it in a loop. Additionally, I remember it being quite frustrating. There is a level of automation.  Rails is a very automated/abstracted framework built on the Ruby language and after working in Sinatra and understanding Object Orientation I see how that automation matters and applies. Specifically using generators allows you to efficiently create a MVC based application and add functionality that is more key to your project without having to write out lots of folders and files. I am starting to see how you could get the boilerplate aspects of your code up an running and then add logic that you should be spending more of your time focusing on anyway. Basically Rails allows you to focus on the value-added parts of your application. Obviously as a beginner, I want to be able to understand each part of the MVC but as I go along I would like to add unique functionality to my projects using gems and APIs.
