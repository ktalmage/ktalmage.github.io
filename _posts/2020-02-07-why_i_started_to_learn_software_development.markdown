In 2014, I wrote a note to my future self and I asked myself what I was doing with my life. I opened that note a few months ago and it really made me think about where I wanted my life to go. After much contemplation and having known a few others who've done something to similar to this, I decided to take this journey.

The reason I started to learn software development was because I found that I liked automating tasks in my previous job. I worked as a tax accountant and much of my job involved analyzing and formatting data (mostly in Excel). I became frustrated in the routine and seasonality of my profession. I became interested in using Excel to automate time consuming tasks and even began learning some Python to help write to Excel. 

After about eight years of working preparing tax returns I realized I was more interested in designing and implementing solutions to many different problems I encountered everyday. I see software development as a powerful skillset to create solutions that can help people and I look forward to learning and being a part of this community.
